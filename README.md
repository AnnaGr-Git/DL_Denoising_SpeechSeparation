# Denoising in Dual-Path-RNN-based Speech Separation
This repository contains the hand-in files of the DTU Deep Learning course Fall 2022 of group 91.

We present two new training approaches for the state-of-the art models in speech separation for usage in noisy environments. Additionally, the models are tested on different noise categories and intensities. The new methods of using an additional output channel for noise data, and employing a cascade approach, both outperform the current method for known noise data. For unknown noise, the performance depends heavily on the noise category and the noise intensity.
